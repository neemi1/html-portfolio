<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Steel Magnolias</h3>
<p>Tear jerker, funny, rom-com. It hits all the feels and delivers some of the most quotable lines. "I wear a size 4 but a 6 feels so good I buy an 8."</p>

<h3>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h3>
<p>Silly doesn't quite cover this movie. Iconically silly does. The Knights who say Nee! Large tracts of land. The Holy Hand Grenade of Anitoch. Coconuts for horses. Tis but a flesh wound. I could go on and on.</p>

<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>This may not be the first rom-com, but it is the rom-com ruler I measure all other rom-coms by. Two people with different personalities meet early in their adult lives, run into each other a few times over ten years, then finally become friends, and then maybe more? Add in the classic line, "I'll have what she's having," and you've got the perfect night curled up on your couch, wrapped in a fleece blanket, and a bowl of popcorn. </p>
